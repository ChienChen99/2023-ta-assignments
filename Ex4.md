## 1. Main Findings from Glover, Pallais and Pariente (2007)

Glover et al discovered that minority workers perform worse when
scheduled to work with managers with manager bias. In such cases,
minority cashiers are found to be absent more often, work shorter hours,
slower in scanning articles, and take more time to transit from serving
one customer to another. Glover et al attributes the under-performance
to less interaction between biased managers and minority cashiers,
resulting in minorities putting in less effort.

## 2. Research Design

### Random Assignment

The assignment of schedule was non-random due to the nature of the work.
However, a quasi-random assignment is employed in this case.

### Regression

Regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of manager bias on
minority performance, controlling for various factors.

### Instrumental Variables

IV was not explicitly mentioned in the experimental design.

### Discontinuity Designs

Discontinuity Designs not mentioned.

### Differences-in-differences

Comparing changes in performance of minority workers in the same shift
as biased managers and unbiased managers is an example of a
differences-in-differences experimental design.

## 3. Threats to inference

There is potential bias in measurement of manager bias. The Implicit
Association Test, while highly accurate, may not perfectly capture
manager bias. For example, some manager might be just happen to cover up
their bias side really well, making detection of bias through such tests
challenging.

The Quasi-random assignment may result in systematic differences that
are not accounted for, thereby affecting the observed outcomes.

Lastly, there may be other unobserved variables that influence how
managers interact with cashiers. For example, some managers could have a
bad day and therefore treated cashiers selectively.

## 4. Possible Causal Hypothesis for patent examiners

I would like to test the hypothesis of whether patent examiners leave
because they are not engaged.

## 5. Research Design Outline

Employing a differences-in-differences and random assignment, I would:

1.  Select a group for new engagement enhancing program randomly.
2.  Gather baseline data on productivity (as a proxy for whether they
    would want to leave) and engagement for both intervention and
    control group
3.  Apply intervention - engaging the intervention group.
4.  Collect same data types post-intervention.
5.  Perform differences-in-differences to compare changes in both groups
    over time, controlling for other factors as much as possible.
